{"name":"DNAshapeR","tagline":"","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nDNAshapeR predicts DNA shape features in an ultra-fast, high-throughput manner from genomic sequencing data. The package takes either nucleotide sequence or genomic intervals as input, and generates various graphical representations for further analysis. DNAshapeR further encodes DNA sequence and shape features for statistical learning applications by concatenating feature matrices with user-defined combinations of k-mer and DNA shape features that can be readily used as input for machine learning algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Version\r\nCurrent stable version is 0.99.1\r\n\r\n### Download and Installation\r\n\r\nPlease make sure you have **the most recent R version (3.2.2 or later)**.\r\n\r\nThe latest (devel) version of DNAshapeR can be installed from this GitHub repository with:\r\n\r\n* Without document\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n library(devtools)\r\n install_github(repo = \"TsuPeiChiu/DNAshapeR\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n* With document\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n library(devtools)\r\n install_github(repo = \"TsuPeiChiu/DNAshapeR\", build_vignettes = TRUE)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe package provides a vignette detailing all steps required to analyze your DNA shape data.
