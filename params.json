{"name":"DNAshapeR","tagline":"","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nDNAshapeR predicts DNA shape features in an ultra-fast, high-throughput manner from genomic sequencing data. The package takes either nucleotide sequence or genomic intervals as input, and generates various graphical representations for further analysis. DNAshapeR further encodes DNA sequence and shape features for statistical learning applications by concatenating feature matrices with user-defined combinations of k-mer and DNA shape features that can be readily used as input for machine learning algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Version\r\nCurrent stable version is 0.99.1\r\n\r\n### Download and Installation\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe package provides a vignette detailing all steps required to analyze your DNA shape data. To view this document for the version of DNAshapeR installed in your system, start R and enter:\r\n\r\n### Citation\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me @ tsupeich@usc.edu","google":"UA-54833735-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
