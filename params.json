{"name":"DNAshapeR","tagline":"","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nDNAshapeR predicts DNA shape features in an ultra-fast, high-throughput manner from genomic sequencing data. The package takes either nucleotide sequence or genomic intervals as input, and generates various graphical representations for further analysis. DNAshapeR further encodes DNA sequence and shape features for statistical learning applications by concatenating feature matrices with user-defined combinations of k-mer and DNA shape features that can be readily used as input for machine learning algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Version\r\nCurrent stable version is 0.99.1\r\n\r\n### Download and Installation\r\nThe latest (devel) version of DNAshapeR can be installed from this GitHub repository with:\r\n```{r}\r\n library(devtools)\r\n install_github(repo = \"TsuPeiChiu/DNAshapeR\", build_vignettes = TRUE)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Basic Usages\r\n```{r}\r\n fn <- system.file(\"extdata\", \"CGRsample.fa\", package = \"DNAshapeR\")\r\n pred <- getShape(fn)\r\n```\r\nVisualization\r\n```{r}\r\n plotShape(pred$MGW)\r\n heatShape(pred$MGW, 20)\r\n fn2 <- system.file(\"extdata\", \"SingleSeqsample.fa\", package = \"DNAshapeR\")\r\n trackShape(fn2, pred) #This function is only for single sequence file\r\n```\r\nFeature Encoding\r\n```{r}\r\n featureNames <- c(\"1-mer\", \"1-shape\") #This can be any combination of \"k-mer\", \"n-shape\", \"n-MGW\", \"n-ProT\", \"n-Roll\", \"n-HelT\" (k, n are integers)\r\n featureVector <- encodeSeqShape(fn, pred, featureNames)\r\n```\r\n \r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe package provides a vignette detailing all steps required to analyze your DNA shape data.
